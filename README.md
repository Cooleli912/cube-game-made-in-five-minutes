# cube game made in five minutes
the funny is i spent 2 days on this.
# Setting the crappy game up
download the game and launch the exe.
# Controls
arrow keys or WASD
# what is the point?
well.... there is no point, but it is my first ever 3d game.
# will you do something with this concept?
maybe yes? maybe no? i'm thinking of a speed styled game like sonic, but with different abilities and its just a cube.
# proof its not a virus!?
screenshots soon?
